**HTML**

Achieved 100% accessibility score for all pages and for Mobile and Desktop devices.

**CSS**

CSS media query for under 500px ensures a responsive layout as specified in the pdf.

**Javascript and database**

All javascript and database criteria met- all playwright tests in coursework-sample.js passed. I also inserted new rows into the database when a person entered already existed instead of updating existing rows as I wasnt sure if the user was adding a second vehicle or replacing their existing one, so I assumed they were adding a second vehicle.
